Data Analysis on Hyatt Corporation
==================================

ABSTRACT
--------
The project was undertaken in the subject IST 687 – Applied Data Science at iSchool, Syracuse University. The dataset consisted of 12 different datasets of different months. Customer feedback is so important because it provides marketers and business owners with insight that they can use to improve their business, products and/or overall customer experience. The broad range of customer data provided to us by Hyatt hotels has been used to analyze various aspects of customer engagement with the hotel and the effect it has on their feedback. With the knowledge that we have obtained from this data Hyatt can get a better understanding of approaches to be taken for their customers to improve the experience they deliver to their future customers.


NPS Conception
--------------
Net Promoter Score measures customer experience and predicts business growth. It transforms the business world by providing the core measurement for customer experience management programs. The NPS assess to what extent a respondent would recommend a certain company, product or service to his friends, relatives or colleagues.
NPS = %Promoters - %Detractors
Respondents are grouped as follows:
● Promoters (score 9-10) are loyal enthusiasts who will keep buying and refer others, fueling growth. 
● Passives (score 7-8) are satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings. 
● Detractors (score 0-6) are unhappy customers who can damage your brand and impede growth through negative word-of-mouth.
It is used by various companies for promotional offers and marketing as it provides a summary of the customer’s experience at the hotel. It determines what factors influence whether a customer would become either a promoter or detractor. By using the NPS type for analysis, Hyatt can understand its customer base and can focus on those specific groups for profit.


Objective
---------
The aim of this project is to determine factors which could help Hyatt corporation improve its customer experience through feedback obtained from its visitors. Customer experience is estimated through the calculation of Net Promoter Score. It also addresses the question where Hyatt should invest its money to focus on the category of customers that are likely to recommend the hotel and how to turn the passives/detractors to promoters.


METHODOLOGY
-----------
The following steps were followed to achieve the objectives:
● Data Extraction and Extrapolation
● Data Cleaning and Preparation
● Data Modeling
● Data Visualization
● Validation of the modeled data
● Recommendations based on analysis

RESULTS and RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------------------
● Facilities like Guest rooms and customer service should be maintained at the same levein order to continue being recommended by other customers.
● Idaho| Delaware |Nebraska |Washington |Tennessee are the states with lowest NPS score, therefore work on improving NPS score from these states.
● Work more on the parameters affecting age groups of 26-45, as they are the major detractors in the United States.
● Based on our predictive analysis we derive that facilities like boutique, fitness centre, laundry room, resort, limo-service and mini-bar have a high significance on NPS score.
